<h1> SpikesLib </h1>
Welcome to SpikesLib! </br>
SpikesLib is an open source, generic library, which extends <a href='https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib'> FRC WPILib </a> by adding useful features to it. </br>
There are many concepts in First Robotics Competition that repeat themeselves every year, with a little different implemantation. SpikesLib 
combines all these concepts into few simple classes which can be used for any robot by any FRC team in the world.
